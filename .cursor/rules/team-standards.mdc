# Team Coding Standards

## Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions focused and small (under 30 lines preferred)
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except in loops)
- Add comments only when the "why" isn't obvious from the code

## Documentation

- All public APIs should have documentation
- Use JSDoc/docstrings for functions with complex parameters
- Keep README files up to date
- Include examples in documentation

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly, don't swallow exceptions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Use appropriate error types/codes

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Git Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable

## Security

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Validate all external inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Follow principle of least privilege
