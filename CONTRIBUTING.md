## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Be concise** - Developers scan, not read
- **Be practical** - Include real examples
- **Be accurate** - Test commands before sharing
- **Be current** - Note version/date for rapidly changing features

### Document Structure
Every guide should include:
1. **TL;DR** at the top - Quick summary
2. **Why it matters** - Context and benefits
3. **How to do it** - Step-by-step with examples
4. **Common issues** - Troubleshooting tips
5. **Resources** - Links to official docs

### Code Examples
```markdown
# Good example
- Specify language in code blocks
- Include comments for non-obvious parts
- Show complete, runnable examples
- Keep examples minimal
```

### Formatting
- Use kebab-case for file names: `my-guide.md`
- Use tables for comparisons
- Use code blocks for commands and prompts
- Keep line lengths reasonable
