> Copilot reads this file to customize its suggestions.

## Project Context

This is a [project type] built with [tech stack].

## Code Style

### General
- Use [language] with strict type checking
- Prefer [paradigm: functional/OOP] approach
- Keep functions small and focused (under 30 lines)
- Use meaningful, descriptive names

### Naming Conventions
- Variables: camelCase
- Functions: camelCase, verb-first (getUserById, calculateTotal)
- Classes/Types: PascalCase
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Files: [your convention: kebab-case/camelCase/PascalCase]

### Formatting
- Indentation: [2/4] spaces
- Line length: max [80/100/120] characters
- Semicolons: [yes/no]
- Quotes: [single/double]

## Patterns & Practices

### Error Handling
- Always use try/catch for async operations
- Create custom error classes for domain errors
- Log errors with context (user ID, request ID, etc.)
- Return user-friendly error messages to clients

### API Design
- Use RESTful conventions
- Return consistent response format: `{ success, data?, error? }`
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validate all inputs

### Testing
- Write tests for all new functions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names: "should [action] when [condition]"
- Mock external dependencies

## Security Requirements

- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Log security-relevant events

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### [Your Framework - e.g., React]
- [Framework-specific convention]
- [Framework-specific convention]

### [Your Database/ORM - e.g., Prisma]
- [Database-specific convention]
- [Database-specific convention]

## Things to Avoid

- Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript
- Don't use deprecated APIs: [list any]
- Avoid synchronous file operations
- Don't commit commented-out code

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc/docstrings to public functions
- Include @param and @returns tags
- Document complex algorithms with inline comments
- Keep README up to date
