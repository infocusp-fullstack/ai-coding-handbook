# Cursor Rules Template

> Create `.cursor/rules/` directory and add .mdc files for your rules.
> Below are templates for different types of rules.

---

## General Rules (general.mdc)

```markdown
---
description: General coding standards for the project
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Project Standards

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Limit function length to 30 lines
- Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except in loops)

## Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context for debugging

## Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep documentation up to date

## Security
- Never commit secrets
- Validate all external inputs
- Use parameterized queries
```

---

## TypeScript Rules (typescript.mdc)

```markdown
---
description: TypeScript-specific conventions
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# TypeScript Standards

## Types
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if truly unknown
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use type aliases for unions and computed types
- Add explicit return types to exported functions

## Patterns
- Use const assertions for literal types
- Prefer optional chaining (?.) over manual checks
- Use nullish coalescing (??) instead of ||
- Destructure objects and arrays when appropriate

## Imports
- Use absolute imports from @/
- Group imports: external, internal, relative
- Avoid circular dependencies
```

---

## React Rules (react.mdc)

```markdown
---
description: React component conventions
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# React Standards

## Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused on one responsibility
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use memo() only when there's a measured performance need

## State
- Prefer useState for local state
- Use context sparingly (prop drilling is often clearer)
- Keep state as local as possible
- Derive state when possible instead of syncing

## Props
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Destructure props in function signature
- Provide default values when sensible
- Use children prop for composition

## Accessibility
- Add aria-labels to interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use semantic HTML elements
```

---

## Testing Rules (testing.mdc)

```markdown
---
description: Testing conventions
globs: ["**/*.test.ts", "**/*.test.tsx", "**/*.spec.ts"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# Testing Standards

## Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Use descriptive test names: "should X when Y"
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- One assertion focus per test (multiple assertions OK if related)

## Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
- Don't mock the module under test
- Use jest.spyOn for partial mocks
- Reset mocks between tests

## Coverage
- Test happy paths and error cases
- Test edge cases and boundaries
- Don't aim for 100% - aim for meaningful coverage
```

---

## API Rules (api.mdc)

```markdown
---
description: API endpoint conventions
globs: ["**/api/**/*.ts", "**/routes/**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: false
---

# API Standards

## Request Handling
- Validate all input using Zod or similar
- Return early on validation failures
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Log request context for debugging

## Response Format
- Use consistent structure: { success, data?, error?, meta? }
- Include pagination metadata for lists
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Never expose internal errors to clients

## Security
- Verify authentication on protected routes
- Check authorization for resources
- Rate limit endpoints
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
```
